Some of the core future modifications:

Error Handling: Implementing error handling mechanisms to handle
exceptions and unexpected inputs.
• Code Refactoring: Analyzing the existing code for opportunities to
improve code structure, readability, and efficiency.
• Performance Optimization: Analyzing performance bottlenecks and
optimizing the code for better efficiency.
• Ul enhancement: adding a start menu, more features to enhance the
overall user experience.
• Perform more testing, using techniques such as Top-down approach,
whiteBox testing, path coverage, and more.
These optimizations are not crucial for the application to work, but they will
definitely enhance the code readability, user experience, and functionality.
